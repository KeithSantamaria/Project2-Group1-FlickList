# Project2-Group1-FlickList
FlickList is a web app for learning about and reviewing movies. Anyone can sign up for an account. Once signed in, users can view trending movies and search for information on 
specific films. Users can leave reviews for films they have seen, and see reviews left by other users. They can also edit their own reviews after they've been saved, and leave 
likes for reviews which they think are helpful.
